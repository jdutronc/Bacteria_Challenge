# Bacteria Challenge

Roza is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Roza's role is to discover and document those bacteria. In particular, Roza is interested in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food start-up, to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi and micro-organisms found on plant roots. However Improbable Beef is still searching for the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste.

Roza has a hypothesis that there's a micro-organism that can supply th next best taste, and she believes that it can be found close to home from bacteria found on the human body. Roza hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button, or at least, in someone's belly button. To test her hypothesis, Roza has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Now Roza wants to build a dashboard tht both her participants and fellow researchers can access.
